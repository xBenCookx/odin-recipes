    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is my all-time favorite meal. As a red meat savant, nothing compares to a perfeclty cooked tri tip roast.</p>
    <p>Listed below are the ingredients you will need for this dish:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tri Tip Roast</strong> -  This beef can also be listed as Santa Maria, Newport Roast, Bottom Sirloin, or triangle roast. Around 2.5lbs is a good amount for around 6-7 people</li>
        <li><strong>Steak Seasoning</strong> - The seasoning is really a personal combination, but usually with red beef, all you need is salt, pepper, and some garlic powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoker</strong> - This recipe is made for a wood or pellet smoker. It does not matter the type of wood pellets you get, they all work great.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Oil and Season</strong> - A tad bit of oil goes a long way. Even though you do not need oil for red meat most of the time, it helps with the moister and makes the seasoning stick better. Seasoning is pretty easy. Just sprinkle as much salt, pepper, adn garlic as desired. I typically sprinle a bit more salt than anything else.</li>

        <li><strong>Smoke and Sear</strong> - Get your smoker to 225° fahrenheit, place the roast, and close the lid. With tri tip, you leave the midde a little pink, so cook the inside of the meat to around 130-135° fahrenheit. Anything past this could possibly ruin the tenderness. Once you smoke it, sear the meat with a little butter to caramelize the crust.
                     Once it is close to temp, heat a cast iron skillet all the way to high heat. The hotter it is, the quicker the sear, and less chance of overcooking the meat. Make sure to drop in a couple pats of butter once the pan is hot.</li>

        <li><strong>Prepare to Serve</strong> - Once cooked, remove immediately and wrap in foil for 10 minutes before you get to slicing. Save the juices and butter in the pan to drizzle on the meat after.
        After letting the meat rest, remove the foil, drizzle the juices, and slice the meat at an angle. <strong>Make sure to cut the tri tip against the grain.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Recipe Complete</h3>
        <p> And voila! You have Tri Tips!</p>
